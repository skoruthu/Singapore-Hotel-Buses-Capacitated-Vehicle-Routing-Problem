# Capacitated-Vehicle-Routing-Singapore-Hotels
Capacitated vehicle routing optimization for shuttle bus service serving hotels in Singapore.  
- Number of routes optimization for real time/distances using googlemaps distance matrix API.
- Demand estimated from hotel occupancy rate, flight arrival, loading factor to account for expected demand of service and time window of the day.
- Hotel demand modeled for 1h time windows (24 total hours)
